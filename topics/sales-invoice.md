# Manual Multi Customer Jobs

For some research and development (R&D) projects you might get a subsidy from one or more organizations.
To receive this subsidy, you probably want to send a sales invoice to the grant provider. 

In the Business Central standard application, this is not possible within one project.
The Multi Customer Jobs solution of Bluace make it possible to create job planning lines for different customers within one project.

## Sales Invoice
You can create your sales invoice via the job planning lines. The only restriction is that you must select the lines for max. 1 Bill-To Customer at the same time.
It is not possible to create the sales invoices via batch invoicing.
